Our natural resources by Octavio Lopez Bautista

So for this proyect i used the a data set from https://ourworldindata.org/ of 3 natural resources (coal, gas and oil). I choose this dataset because i had some ideas regarding the analysis that i could extract from this informartion. 

Since this dataset had information of all the world, the first thing i did was show a map of the reserves of each country, that way we can see witch countries produces resources and wich not.

Now that i have this information i can show whether the amount of resources has been increasing or decreasing over the years and that way i can see the spikes shown and ma0ke a deeper investigation of what happend in that year that make the graph drop or increase.

So far i've showed worldwide data,general information, so the next thing is showing a table of all the exports and imports of each country. This table can show us if a country exports more than it imports or vice versa, that way we can tell if the country is reach in resources or if it depends from other countries.

The consumption of resources over the years would be closing statement so we can see how irresponsible we've been with our natural resources.

Extra:

The most valuable out of this three resources would be the oil, so i display the top 10 imports and exports of oil in the world.

Improvements :

*Make the map more interactive so if you click on a country you can display all the informartion that you need, instead of seeig all the information from all the countries. I think that giving that option would make easier to analize.

*Customize more the information, like putting the top 5 countrys with more production or less production of the choosen resource.
